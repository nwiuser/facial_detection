**Image and Video Detection using Python**

*Introduction*
This project demonstrates how to perform object detection on both images and videos using Python. Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects within an image or video. This README will guide you through setting up the project and running the detection code.

*Prerequisites*
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
Numpy library

**Detection Process Overview:**

The detection process typically involves the following steps:

Loading Images/Videos: Load the images or videos from the specified source.
Preprocessing: Preprocess the images if necessary, such as resizing, converting color spaces, or normalization.
Detection: Use a detection model or algorithm to identify objects or patterns within the images or videos.
Drawing Boundaries: Visualize the detected objects by drawing bounding boxes or other markers.
Displaying/Outputting Results: Display the results or save them to a file, depending on the application requirements.
